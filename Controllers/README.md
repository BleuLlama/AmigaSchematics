# Controllers

This directory contains schematics captured for various controllers 
that are plugged in through the DB9 "joystick" port on the Amiga.

Included here are:

* [CD32] four-button controller for the Amiga CD32.

* [Jaguar] jaguar controller.

I know it's not Amiga related, but i wanted to put it online somewhere.
